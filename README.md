# Retention Analysis of Transaction

## 🗂️ Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze the customer retention rate based on transaction data. The goal is to understand how well the business retains its customers over time. This analysis will help me identify repeat purchase patterns, factors influencing retention, and opportunities to enhance customer loyalty.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Calculate Retention Rate: Measure the percentage of customers who return to make a purchase within a specific period.
2. Identify Retention Trends: Analyze time-based patterns and customer characteristics that contribute to retention.
3. Provide Recommendations: Develop strategies based on retention insights to improve customer loyalty.

## 📊 Data Description
The dataset contains the following information:

- Transaction Details: Includes transaction data, such as dates, transaction IDs, and order statuses.
- Customer Details: Contains customer IDs to track repeat purchases.
- Product Details: Information about purchased products, including brand, product line, and pricing.
- Order Details: Covers order status (online/offline) and order size.
  
Analysis Steps:
- Identify unique customers in each period (monthly/yearly).
- Track repeat purchases from unique customers in the subsequent period.
- 
Calculate the retention rate as:
Retention Rate = Number of Returning Customers / Number of Customers in the Previous Period × 100 %
